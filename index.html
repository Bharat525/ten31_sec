                <p>The air bubbles formed during the manufacturing of TEN 31
                    Blocks form a honeycomb structure which provides high
                    compressive strength, also the use of high quality raw
                    materials like OPC cement, gypsum etc. increases the
                    binding force at the molecular level.</p>

                <p>TEN 31 Blocks when submerged in water, floats up
magically. They weigh 1/3rd of what clay bricks weigh and
yet are stronger. This saves up to 20% on the cost of
structure by decreasing the dead loads of the building.</p>

            <div class="q-item">
                <p>The large size, uniform shape, precise cut and unmatched

which are Water Resistant, Fireproof, Earthquake Proof,
Pest Proof and has high Thermal and Noise Insulation
properties.</p>

                <p>TEN 31 Blocks are very cost effective as it saves on labor,
sand, cement, plaster, water, structure, wastage etc.
leading up to 30% savings in the cost of the project.
Constructions made of TEN 31 Blocks also leads to
increased carpet area and lower electricity consumption.</p>

            <div class="q-item">
                <p>Though quite new in India, AAC Blocks are very well
trialled & tested product being used in other parts of the
world like Europe and UAE for over 70 years. AAC blocks
are much better than conventional bricks to fight the
effect of weather and have proven to be highly durable.</p>
